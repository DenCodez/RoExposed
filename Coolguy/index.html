            <h2>CoolGuy</h2>
            <p>CoolGuy, a roblox player who is exposed on this website for being a pedofile. The owner of the website, (@Den21NULL142 <img src="../webassets/DennyBwai.png" height="20" width="20" alt="den21null142UserProfile" title="Owner">) Den was a victim. Den's first account which is @Aaroosh855IQ. He abandoned that account. In that account, Den met CoolGuy (Previous name was @GlitchBeastKid) in a Baldi's Basics RP Roblox game. After sometime, I (Den) started creating a friendship bond with him like a normal person. One thing I came to know about him is that, he liked to roleplay very very much. Every single sentence he said, he roleplayed. like for example, "Ugh *sighs* why did you do this?". That "<mark style="background-color: rgb(105, 191, 240); color: white;">*sighs*</mark>" is a part of roleplaying.
            Now, I tried to stop him from roleplaying too much because it became annoying. But I roleplayed too to make him happy or something. Now, a part came where he asked me to do <strong>HORRIBLE</strong> stuff. And by that, I meant doing sexual shit. I was like "No way bruh I am NOT doing that". He kept forcing me. But I had no choice but to do that.
            </p>
            <p>By "it" he meant (... ..- -.-. -.- / .... .. ... / -.. .. -.-. -.-). I am still traumatized to this day but 98% is gone so nothing to worry about. My (Den) gender is male too so, what he did is basically gay stuff.</p>
            <br>.
