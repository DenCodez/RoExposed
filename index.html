        <p class="main_desc">This website is about roblox players being exposed. You can see the introduction of the player, see the reason, and evidences against them. This website does not exhibit any false information. You can fully trust this website. Website was originally published on github <span>(<a href="https://github.com/DenCodez/RoExposed">https://github.com/DenCodez/RoExposed</a>)</span>. Keep in mind that this website is still developing. This is just a pre-launch of the website. If you have trouble opening an individual, then it is in development. Hover your cursor over the individual button. After a few seconds, if a text which says "Not available" shows, then it is in development. If not, it is most probably a bug. If you encounter this bug, try refreshing the page. If it still doesn't work, then open an issue in the github issues tab. Not only saying for this specific bug, you can report any types of bug. Do not continue viewing this page further if you are under 18, because it may contain explicit and disturbing content ⚠️</p>
