            <p class="bio_roblox">CEO of <strong>Roblox</strong> is David Baszucki. He is currently 62, and he is ruining a platform made for kids by standing with pedofiles.
            So, recently roblox has terminated a user called "Schlep" who catches predetors on roblox and arrests them in real life by deploying a decoy. Roblox banned him for "violating community guidelines" even though he was protecting kids from pedofiles.
            because of this, the roblox community is angry at Roblox and David Baszucki. People are protesting against Roblox to unban schlep. And Roblox didn't. People used #FreeSchlep everywhere. Just because of this, many many countries has banned roblox, considering that it is unsafe for kids. And some countries banned chat feature on roblox like UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey. Many many people are leaving Roblox, because of this Roblox is loosing money. After all of this, Roblox released an update, which is age verification. People were <strong>NOT</strong> happy with this at all. Russia banned Roblox and Russian kids started protesting to bring Roblox back but Russia said to make a Russian version of the Roblox game.
            Even though, Roblox said it will delete its data after the age verification. You can do the age verification process by taking a selfie or uploading a clear picture of your driver's license, NID (National ID) or passport. This age verification thingy was recognized by bots because Roblox is too lazy to hire human moderators. Because of this, many people were put in the wrong age groups, just because they look younger/older. Age groups can't talk with older/younger age groups (13-15 can chat with 9-17 y/o). This caused many games get silent. People under 13 can't use Roblox chat but can use experience chat. After this age verification update, millions of people left Roblox and people started playing other games like Minecraft, Fortnite, etc.
            Roblox really thought that this age verification update would make the community safer but no, people literally quit Roblox, causing them to loose a lot of money.
